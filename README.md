# Welcome!
This is the GameBot repository, a summer project between Alexis Nemsingh and Carlos Valdez. This document will include 
the requirements for the project as well as the tools we'll be using.

# Requirements
- Randomly select a game from a list
- Use Discord's new bot UI
- Have a database of games... somewhere?
- And (eventually) more

# Tools
We will be using...
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  - If things get too complicated, we can just use regular JavaScript
- [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/)
